<p>The Scottish Demersal Joint Observer Programme is a scientific project run by the Scottish Government’s Marine Directorate and the <a href="https://sff.co.uk/">Scottish Fishermen’s Federation</a>. The main purpose of the scheme is to collect biological data from fishing trips for stock assessments carried out by the <a href="https://www.ices.dk/Pages/default.aspx">International Council for the Exploration of the Sea</a>.</p>

<strong>How It Works</strong>
<ul>
<li>Observers cover ~1–2 % of trawl fishing trips each year.</li>
<li>They record biological details including species, size, and age.</li>
<li>Observers take samples of bycatch (fish and other species caught unintentionally) during sorting on board.</li>
</ul>

<p>The information collected by the scientific observers is used in the statistical estimation of weights, numbers-at-length and numbers-at-age by species, area and fishery. These estimates are submitted to ICES for use in single species stock assessments. The bycatch weight estimates are also used in fisheries management.</p>
