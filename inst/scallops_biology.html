<p> Scallops are bivalve molluscs that live in the waters around Scotland and the wider north-east Atlantic coast. They can be found on the sea bed anywhere from just below the low water mark to depths exceeding 100 m, preferring sediments comprising sand, gravel and mud.</p>

<p>Scallops filter feed on suspended phytoplankton and other micro-organisms. If undisturbed, scallops usually lie recessed into the sediments. Although considered sedentary, scallops are able to swim limited distances propelled by jets of water.</p>

<p>Scallops are hermaphrodites and release male and female gametes separately into the surrounding water. Fertilised eggs develop into free-swimming larvae that migrate towards the sea surface, spending three weeks or more in the water column. Larvae are affected by water circulation, tides and wind driven currents when they are near the surface. This makes it very difficult to predict where they eventually settle, which may be some distance from the parent population.</p>

<p>In Scottish waters, scallops spawn for the first time in the autumn of their second year, and subsequently each year in the spring or autumn. After settlement, scallops grow until their first winter during which growth usually ceases. Thereafter, growth resumes in spring and ceases in winter causing distinct rings to be formed on the external surface of the shell. These annual growth rings can be used to determine the age and growth rate of scallops. Environmental factors such as water temperature and food availability affect growth rates, which vary between areas.</p>
