<p>Age determination is generally not possible for animals which moult and application of age-structured assessment methods to crustacean stocks is problematic. Length Cohort Analysis (LCA) is the method used for assessing lobster stocks. It uses official landings and length frequency data collected as part of the Marine Directorate market sampling programme. LCA results are presented in terms of yield-per-recruit and biomass-per-recruit, providing estimates of fishing mortality (F) and a framework for evaluation of management measures. Assuming a direct relationship between fishing mortality and effort, generally, lower levels of fishing effort will result in an increase in stock size and a reduction in landings. A higher level of fishing effort will reduce total stock biomass but landings may also fall, as animals are caught before they have had time to grow to a size that would contribute much weight to the yield (growth overfishing). In between these lies F<sub>MAX</sub>, the fishing mortality rate that maximizes yield per recruit. It is not possible to directly estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for these stocks and hence F<sub>MAX</sub> is used as a proxy for F<sub>MSY</sub>. The changes that the LCA predicts are long term (equilibrium). The method does not provide any indication of short-term stock dynamics or recruitment over-fishing. Assessments are performed on a regional basis for males and females separately.</p>
