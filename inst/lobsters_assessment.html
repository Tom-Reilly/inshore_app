<p>Lobster stocks are assessed regionally using a method called Length Cohort Analysis (LCA). This approach works well for data-limited fisheries and uses information from commercial landings, length frequency data (collected as part of the MD market sampling programme), and biological estimates like growth and natural mortality to estimate fishing mortality at length. Due to differences in these biological parameters, stock assessments are conducted separately for male and female lobster.</p>

<p>The assessments aim to understand whether reducing fishing effort (F) could lead to better long-term yields by allowing lobster to grow larger before being caught.  It is not possible to directly estimate the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), instead scientists use a proxy, which estimates the fishing level that gives the best yield per recruit. If fishing exceeds this level, the stock is considered overexploited.</p>

<p>In addition to LCA, other tools like length-based indicators also help evaluate stock health. The latest assessments were shared with managers and stakeholders in 2025 and will be publicly available soon.</p>
