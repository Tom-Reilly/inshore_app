<p>Analytic stock assessments are conducted for king scallops using SAM, which is a state-space stock assessment model. The SAM uses reported landings data, age  frequency data collected as part of the Marine Directorate (MD) market sampling programme and catch at age data from the annual MD scallop dredge surveys which are conducted around the coast of mainland Scotland and Shetland.</p>

<p>The model provides estimated outputs for catch, fishing mortality, recruits and spawning stock biomass. Recent work has also developed provisional precautionary reference points so that advice can be provided to fishery managers.</p>
