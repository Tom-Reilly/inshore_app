<p>Analytic stock assessments in the main scallop assessment areas: East Coast, North East, North West, Shetland and West of Kintyre were conducted using SAM,  which is a state-space stock assessment model that is similar to the previously used Time Series Analysis (TSA). The SAM uses reported landings data, age and length frequency data collected as part of the Marine Directorate (MD) market sampling programme and catch at age data from the annual MD scallop dredge surveys which are conducted around the coast of mainland Scotland and Shetland. The state of the stock in a particular year is described by a vector of stock numbers-at-age and fishing mortality-at-age (the ‘state vector’).  The ‘state equations’ define how this vector changes over time; <em>i.e.</em> how the numbers-at-age in a particular year relate to the numbers-at-age and fishing mortality-at-age in the previous year.  This vector is related to the data or observations (catch-at-age data and survey data) through ‘observation equations’.</p>

<p>Stocks in Orkney are not routinely surveyed; the Clyde is now routinely surveyed, however there are insufficient data for SAM; and the Irish Sea assessment area is sampled in collaboration with international partners. As a result of the international nature of the Irish Sea fishery, the ICES Scallop Assessment Working Group (<a href="https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGScallop.aspx">WGScallop</a>) is now considered to be best placed to collate data and develop stock assessments for this area.</p>
