<p>Scotland's inshore waters extend from the coast out to 12 nautical miles (NM), with a concentration of fishing taking place within 6 NM. There are over 2,000 active Scottish fishing vessels and three quarters of them fish primarily in inshore waters. Typically these are smaller boats of 8-10 metres in length with one or two crew members, fishing daily from local ports. The inshore fleet is diverse and includes trawlers, creelers, netters, dredgers and divers. The main target of inshore fisheries are shellfish species, including <i>Nephrops</i>, scallops, brown crab, lobster, velvet crab, and razor clams. Shellfish fisheries are a vital part of Scotland’s marine economy, contributing significantly to employment, exports, and the sustainability of coastal communities.  In 2024, shellfish landings by Scottish vessels were valued at £161 million, representing a substantial portion of the total £703 million landed across all sectors <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/provisional-scottish-sea-fisheries-statistics-2024/">Scottish Sea Fisheries Statistics</a>.</p>

<p>Defining "inshore" fisheries can be complex, especially when many shellfish species have extended biological ranges that span both inshore and offshore waters, including the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The species detailed in this dashboard are classified as "inshore" because they are typically exploited by smaller vessels, there are often regional and local management frameworks in place, and they are economically important to rural and coastal communities.</p>
