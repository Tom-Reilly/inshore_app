<p>The Marine Directorate (MD) of the Scottish Government is responsible for the management of Scotland's inshore fisheries. There are over 2,000 active Scottish fishing vessels and three quarters of them fish primarily in inshore waters. Typically these are smaller boats of 8-10 metres in length with one or two crew members, fishing daily from local ports. The inshore fleet is diverse and includes trawlers, creelers, netters, dredgers and divers. The main target of inshore fisheries are shellfish species. This app presents the work that MD undertakes to manage the inshore fisheries of Scotland.</p>
