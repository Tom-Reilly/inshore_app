<p>Wrasse species are considered a data limited stock. There are very limited data on wrasse populations from existing survey programmes, as trawl surveys tend to avoid rocky inshore grounds where wrasses are usually most abundant. Existing trawl surveys catch wrasse only infrequently, and it is unlikely these surveys could be used to inform on stock trends.</p>

<p>For the wrasse fishery, vessels derogated to catch wrasse are required to submit science return forms which report the number of wrasse landed by species for all pots deployed. More detailed information is collected on the catches from the first 20 pots hauled for each fishing trip, detailing the number of wrasse (by species) retained within the permitted landing size and the number returned to the sea both within and outwith the permitted size range.</p>
