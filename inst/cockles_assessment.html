<p>Sampled data were raised to the total site based on area sampled and total area of site. For each site the total abundance, abundance variance, total biomass weight, and weight variance were estimated. The overall biomass estimate (all ages on all grounds) was 24569.2 tonnes in 2023 and 12882.6 tonnes in 2024 . In 2023, biomass was highest for North Bank (11591.4 tonnes) but this had fallen to 2595.2 tonnes in 2024.  In 2024, cockle biomass was highest on Wigtown Bay (4707.7 tonnes). In terms of commercial sized (aged 2+) cockles, the harvestable biomass was estimated as 4793.9 tonnes in 2023 and 6774.2 tonnes in 2024, which equates to 19.5 % (2023) and 52.6% (2024) of the estimated total cockle biomass. Comparisons of the age structure of cockles on different grounds revealed that in 2023 the cockle biomass was dominated by cockles aged 0 and 1 year old. Highest cockle abundance was observed on  Arbigland, Carsethorn, North Bank and Wigtown Bay in 2023, and Arbigland, North Bank and Wigtown Bay  in 2024.
