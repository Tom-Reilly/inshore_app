<p>The European lobster (<i>Homarus gammarus</i>) is found all around Scotland’s coast, from the low tide mark to depths of about 60 meters. They favour rocky habitats and crevices, especially in clear, hard-bottom areas like reefs and on the fringes of kelp beds. Lobsters are relatively sedentary, typically moving only short distances along the shore.</p>

<p>Adult lobsters feed mainly on benthic invertebrates such as crabs, molluscs, sea urchins, worms, and starfish, but may also consume fish and algae. Growth is highly variable and occurs through moulting. Juveniles moult frequently and grow quickly, while older lobsters moult less often. The main moulting period is June to July.</p>

<p>Mating takes place shortly after the female moults, when her shell is still soft. Females produce 10,000–15,000 eggs, which develop internally for up to a year before being carried under the tail for 9–11 months. </p>
