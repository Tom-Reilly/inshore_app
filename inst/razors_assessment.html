<p>Length Cohort Analysis (LCA) is a commonly-used method of assessing stocks for which commercial catch length frequency distribution data are available. This assessment method has been used in the past by Marine Directorate in the assessment of other species such as crabs and lobsters. The LCA method uses commercial catch composition data (length frequency data) and estimates of growth parameters and natural mortality to estimate fishing mortality at length.</p>

<p>The LCA results are used to calculate the yield-per-recruit (YPR) and biomass-per-recruit (BPR) relative to changes in fishing mortality (F) which can be used to provide an indication of stock status in terms of growth overfishing.</p>
