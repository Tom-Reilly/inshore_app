<p>This is a trial fishery and assessment methodologies are still under development.  Some of the razor clam trial areas are assessed regionally using a method called Length Cohort Analysis (LCA). This approach works well for data-limited fisheries and uses information from commercial landings, length frequency data (collected from trial particpants), and biological estimates like growth and natural mortality to estimate fishing mortality at length.</p>

<p>The assessments aim to understand whether reducing fishing effort (F) could lead to better long-term yields by allowing razor clams to grow larger before being caught.  It is not possible to directly estimate the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), instead scientists use a proxy, which estimates the fishing level that gives the best yield per recruit. If fishing exceeds this level, the stock is considered overexploited.</p>

<p>In addition to LCA, other tools like length-based indicators and LPUE trends help evaluate stock health.</p>
