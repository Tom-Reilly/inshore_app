<p>The velvet crab is a member of the family <i>Portunidae</i> (swimming crabs) and is found in waters all around the British Isles. It is a fast moving and aggressive species, most commonly found on rocky substrates down to depths of about 25 meters.</p>

<p>Velvet crabs feed on both animal and algal material, with brown algae being the dominant item found in gut content analysis. Females grow slower and to a smaller maximum size than males, differences which are likely to be due to reduced growth during the females egg bearing phase. Growth is highly seasonal and males and females moult at different times of the year; the main moult for males is between April and July whereas females moult between May and August.</p>

<p>Mating occurs after females have moulted, when the shell is still soft. In contrast to brown crabs, there is no evidence that velvet crabs undertake extensive migrations. Their movements are thought to be restricted to a few hundred metres.</p>
