<p>The brown crab fishery is long established and is economically very important for Scotland. Previously, most brown crab were caught inshore in mixed species creel fisheries. From the mid-1980s technological advances allowed the fishery to expand to offshore areas to the west and north of Scotland. The majority of crabs are landed in the third and fourth quarters of the year and a large proportion of landed crabs are exported live to European markets.</p>
