<p>Whilst there is no direct research vessel survey for brown crabs, scallop and trawl surveys undertaken by Marine Directorate are used as an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/78/2/597/5880823?login=false">index for brown crab abundance and distribution</a>.</p>

<p> Scientists visit markets and processers all around Scotland to obtain length frequency data for brown crab as part of the Marine Directorate (MD) market sampling programme. Crabs are sexed and the carapace width measured using digital callipers. Care is taken when handling the live crabs to avoid damaging the product.</p>

<p>In 2023, 7,722 individuals were measured and sexed from the North Sea and 2,009 individuals measured and sexed from the west coast. Details of sample numbers can be found in the 2023 report, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-collection-framework">here</a>.</p>
