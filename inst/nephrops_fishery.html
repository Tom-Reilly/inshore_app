<p> It is a commercially valuable species and of high importance to the Scottish fishing industry. Most Nephrops are caught by trawlers, but creel fisheries are also important, particularly on the west coast of Scotland.</p>

<p>Since most <em>Nephrops</em> fishing is by trawling, and because animals are protected from trawls when in burrows, the emergence patterns affect catch rates.  The timing of emergence to feed appears related to light level, and greatest catches are often taken at dawn and dusk, although this may vary with water depth and clarity.  As ‘berried’ females rarely come out of the burrow, they are naturally protected from trawlers.  Males dominate trawl catches for most of the year and are more heavily exploited than females.</p>
