<p><i>Nephrops</i> was the most valuable shellfish species landed into Scotland in 2024, with Scottish vessels landing 18,000 tonnes worth £76 million. Most <i>Nephrops</i> are caught by trawlers, but creel fisheries are also important, particularly on the West coast of Scotland. Much of the catch is exported, particularly to high-value markets in France and Spain, where Scottish langoustines are prized for their quality.</p>

<p><i>Nephrops</i> are protected from trawls when in their burrows, so emergence patterns affect catch rates. The timing of emergence to feed appears related to light level, and highest catches are often taken at dawn and dusk, although this may vary with water depth and clarity. As ‘berried’ females rarely come out of the burrow, they are naturally protected from trawlers. Males typically dominate trawl catches for most of the year and are more heavily exploited than females.</p>
