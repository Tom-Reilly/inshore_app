<p>For the purposes of stock assessment, <em>Nephrops</em> around Scotland are split into a number of stocks or 'functional units' (FUs) based on the discrete patches of mud which they inhabit. Unlike fish, <em>Nephrops</em> cannot be aged directly and therefore the stock assessments make use of size composition data from catches, combined with information on stock abundance obtained from underwater television (UWTV) surveys. UWTV cameras are used on research vessel surveys to estimate Nephrops burrow density on the seabed.  The information gathered provides an index of stock abundance for each FU which is independent of the fishery and burrow emergence patterns.   By applying a conversion factor to the relative abundance index, an estimate of the absolute abundance of Nephrops is obtained.  A proxy for fishing mortality known as the ‘harvest rate’ is derived as the ratio of total catch to absolute abundance. Assessments are carried out on an annual basis by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) through the <a href="https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGNEPS.aspx">Working Group on Nephrops Surveys (WGNEPS)</a>.
