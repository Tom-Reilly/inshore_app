<p>For the purposes of stock assessment, <i>Nephrops</i> around Scotland are split into a number of stocks or 'functional units' (FUs) based on the discrete patches of mud which they inhabit. Unlike fish, <i>Nephrops</i> cannot be aged directly and therefore the stock assessments make use of size composition data from catches, combined with information on stock abundance obtained from surveys.</p>

<p>Underwater cameras record video footage of <i>Nephrops</i> burrows.  The footage is reviewed and the data collected are used to derive an estimate of stock abundance. Fishing pressure is expressed as a harvest rate which is defined as the ratio of total catch to absolute abundance. Assessments are carried out on an annual basis by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES). <a href="https://ices-taf.shinyapps.io/advicexplorer/">The latest advice for <i>Nephrops</i> FU</a>.</p>
