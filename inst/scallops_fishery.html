<p>The Scottish commercial fishery for scallops predominantly target king scallops, however there is also a small fishery for queen scallops. The Scottish fishery for king scallops began as a seasonal fishery in the Clyde in the 1930s and developed rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, expanding to other west coast grounds. Fisheries around Shetland and in the Moray Firth also developed over this period, followed by fisheries off the east coast of the Scotland in the 1980s. Nowadays, fishing takes place all year round. Most scallops are caught using arrays of specialized dredges attached to bars towed from either side of the vessel. The scallop fleet comprises small vessels that tend to work locally in inshore waters and some larger vessels, up to about 30 m in length, which are capable of fishing grounds around Scotland and the rest of the UK. Over 95% of scallop landings come from dredge fisheries with the remainder taken by commercial divers.</p>

<p>Since the 17<sup>th</sup> June 2024, it is a mandatory requirement for any fishing boat which deploys scallop dredges in the Scottish zone, and any Scottish fishing boat which deploys scallop dredges outwith the Scottish zone to operate Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) equipment, as per the legislation <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2024/165/contents/made">The Sea Fisheries (Remote Electronic Monitoring and Regulation of Scallop Fishing) (Scotland) Regulations 2024 (the REM legislation)</a>.</p>
