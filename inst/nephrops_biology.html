<p> <em>Nephrops norvegicus</em> (also known as Norway lobster, langoustine, scampi, and Dublin Bay prawn) is a marine decapod crustacean, widely distributed throughout the Northeast Atlantic.  It is a mud burrowing species and constructs burrow complexes with distinctive crescent-shaped entrances. <em>Nephrops</em> distribution is limited by the extent of suitable muddy sediment in which to construct their burrows. <em>Nephrops</em> spend most of their time in burrows, only coming out to feed and look for a mate. They are opportunistic predators, feeding primarily on crustaceans, molluscs and polychaete worms.</p>

<p>Female <em>Nephrops</em> usually mature at around three years of age and reproduce each year thereafter.  Mating takes place in early summer.  Females spawn in September, and carry eggs under their tails (described as being ‘berried’) until they hatch in April or May.  The larvae develop in the plankton before settling to the seabed six to eight weeks later.</p>

<p>Nephrops in different areas grow at different rates and mature at different sizes.  This variation is related to the density of animals and sediment type.  On the softest mud, Nephrops densities are low, but the animals grow relatively fast, and reach a larger maximum size. On sandier mud, Nephrops density is much higher, but the animals grow relatively slowly.  In the North Sea there are differences in growth between stocks, while on the west coast, there are also differences between areas within the same stock.</p>
