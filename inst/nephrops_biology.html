<p><i>Nephrops norvegicus</i> (also known as Norway lobster, langoustine, scampi, and Dublin Bay prawn) is a marine decapod crustacean, widely distributed throughout the Northeast Atlantic. It is a mud burrowing species and constructs burrow complexes with distinctive crescent-shaped entrances. <i>Nephrops norvegicus</i> distribution is limited by the extent of suitable muddy sediment in which to construct their burrows. <i>Nephrops norvegicus</i> spend most of their time in burrows, only coming out to feed and look for a mate. They are opportunistic predators, feeding primarily on crustaceans, molluscs and polychaete worms.</p>

<p>Female <i>Nephrops</i> usually mature at around three years of age and reproduce each year thereafter.  Mating takes place in early summer. Females spawn in September, and carry eggs under their tails (described as being ‘berried’) until they hatch in April or May. The larvae develop in the plankton before settling to the seabed six to eight weeks later.</p>

<p><i>Nephrops</i> growth and maturity vary by area, influenced by animal density and sediment type. On soft mud, densities are generally low, but growth is faster and individuals reach larger sizes. On sandier mud, densities are higher but growth is typically slower.</p>
