<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2017/419/pdfs/ssifia_20170419_en.pdf">The Razor Clams (Prohibition on Fishing and Landing) (Scotland) Order 2017</a> prohibited fishing for razor clams in Scottish waters and landings of razor clams into Scotland, unless for scientific investigation or by the traditional hand gathering of razor clams from the shore. A trial electrofishery for razor clams officially started in February 2018. Electrofishing for razor clams involves towing electrodes slowly over the seabed behind a fishing vessel to create an electric field. The electric field elicits a response from the razor clams, and they emerge from burrows allowing divers to collect marketable clams by hand.</p>
