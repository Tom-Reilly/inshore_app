<p>Anecdotal information from the Scottish fishing industry suggests there has been a targeted fishery for razor clams for many years, but a trial fishery was officially started in February 2018. Electrofishing for razor clams involves towing electrodes slowly over the seabed behind a fishing vessel to create an electric field. The electric field elicits a response from the razor clams, and they emerge from burrows allowing divers to collect marketable clams by hand.</p>
