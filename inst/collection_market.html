<p>Scotland runs two main shellfish sampling schemes—one for the mainland (including Orkney and the west coast islands) and one for Shetland.</p>

<strong>Mainland</strong>
<ul>
<li>Biological data collected on five shellfish species: <i>Nephrops</i> (Norway lobster), scallops, lobsters, edible crabs and velvet crabs.</li>
<li>The mainland is divided into 15 sampling areas, based on geography and local landing ports and processors.</li>
<li>This scheme can potentially cover 78 % of Scotland’s shellfish landings. The remaining 22 % comes from small boats landing in remote areas.</li>
<li>Sampling is done during designated weeks, based on where and when shellfish are available. It’s not random—sampling is opportunistic.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Shetland</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data collection managed separately under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).</li>
<li>Focuses on four species (excluding <i>Nephrops</i>, which are not typically landed in Shetland).</li>
<li>Targets are set for how many samples to collect for each species.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Data Collection</strong>
<p>For each shellfish, measurements are taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shell or carapace length for all species.</li>
<li>Sex and breeding condition for <i>Nephrops</i>, crab and lobster.</li>
<li>Ages for scallops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data is used to estimate numbers by age or size, with statistical methods to calculate confidence intervals.  All data is stored in national databases and analysed using a documented R package, with strict quality checks at every stage.</p>
