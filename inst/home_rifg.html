<p>The Regional Inshore Fisheries Groups (RIFGs) are non-statutory bodies that aim to improve the management of fisheries in the 0-12 nautical mile zone of Scottish waters and to give commercial inshore fishers a strong voice in wider marine planning initiatives. The RIFG network currently comprises 6 national groups. These groups are the North and East Coast, North West Coast, Orkney, Outer Hebrides, Shetland and South West Coast.</p>
