<p>The common cockle (<em>Cerastoderma edule</em>) is a bivalve mollusc found in estuaries and sandy bays around Scotland, predominantly on the West coast. They inhabit the surface of sediments (sand, mud or muddy gravel), burrowing to depths up to 5 cm.</p>

<p><em>Cerastoderma edule</em> are suspension filter feeders and tend to grow rapidly in years 1-2. Growth rates however are dependent on a large number of factors, such as season, age, temperature regime, geogrpahical location and population density. The common cockle grows to around 40 mm, with the males larger than females. Adults are mature by the time they reach 15-20 mm in size. In the UK spawning generally occurs between March and August, but is heavily site dependent.</p>
