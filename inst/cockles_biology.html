<p>The common cockle (<i>Cerastoderma edule</i>) is a bivalve mollusc found in intertidal sandy and muddy shores around Scotland.  Cockles are a key shellfish species in Scotland’s inshore fisheries, particularly in areas like the Solway Firth. Their ecological role and commercial value make them an important focus for sustainable management.</p>

<p>Cockles inhabit the surface of sediments (sand, mud or muddy gravel), burrowing to depths up to 5 cm.  They are filter feeders, drawing plankton and organic matter from the water and tend to grow rapidly in years one and two. Growth rates however are dependent on a large number of factors, such as season, age, temperature regime, geographical location and population density.  Cockles typically reach maturity within two years and can live up to nine years. Spawning occurs in warmer months, but is heavily site dependent, with larvae dispersing widely before settling.</p>
