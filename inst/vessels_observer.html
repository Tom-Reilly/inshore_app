<p>The Science Evidence Data and Digital Portfolio of the Marine Directorate of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation undertake the Scottish Demersal Joint Observer Programme. This is a scientific observer scheme for sampling biological information on catch on board vessels, carried out under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-collection-framework">UK Data Collection Framework</a>.</p>

<p>This is a statistical survey which covers around 1-2&percnt; of trawl fishing trips per year. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide parameters for stock assessments carried out by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (<a href="https://www.ices.dk">ICES</a>). Therefore statistical approaches are required in order to estimate these parameters. The scientific observers obtain a sample of bycatch at the time of sorting, from which they obtain biological information. The sample could include species which are subject to the landing obligation, and species which are not <em>e.g.</em> non-quota and prohibited species. The observers estimate the quantity of the total bycatch in the same units that they use to record the quantity of the sample. The units in which these quantities are recorded include non-SI units such as baskets, tables, shovels, or time, and do not necessarily pertain to meaningful estimates of quantity without appropriate conversion.</p>

<p>On fishing trips targeting <em>Nephrops</em>, observers will sample <em>Nephrops</em> on one day and fish on the other. These data are stored in the Marine Directorate database as separate trips. When <em>Nephrops</em> are sampled, observers will take samples from each of the landing categories and bycatch separately for each haul. When fish are sampled, observers will take a sample of bycatch from each haul, and a sample from each landing category for cod, haddock, whiting and saithe for the trip.</p>

<p>The information collected by the scientific observers is used in the statistical estimation of weights, numbers-at-length and numbers-at-age of bycatch by species, area and fishery. These estimates for each calendar year are submitted to ICES for use in single species stock assessments. The bycatch weight estimates are also used in fisheries management.</p>

<p>The data are collected from a sample of trawls on a sample of fishing trips, and are inherently highly variable, and can vary widely by species and length between samples. They are not intended for use at the trawl or trip level, but need to be pooled into estimates at a wider spatial, technical and temporal range. Due to the high cost of data collection, and hence relatively small sample sizes, the resulting estimates can be quite variable even at an annual level and for the spatial areas used by ICES. Using these data on a finer spatial, technical or temporal scale than they were intended is likely to lead to potentially misleading results, for example, incorrectly identifying hotspots or hot-times by ascribing random variability in highly variable data to spatial, temporal or other effects.</p>
