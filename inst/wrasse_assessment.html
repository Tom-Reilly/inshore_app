<p>Age determination is generally not possible for a live fishery, and application of age-structured assessment methods to live fishery stocks is problematic. Similarly, there are no stock assessments for any species of wrasse in UK waters, with biological data limited.</p>

<p>The stock structure for wrasse is unknown. There are no robust indicators of population size for wrasses, due to their biological characteristics (limited adult home range, longevity, complex reproductive biology) and their management through harvest slot size limits.</p>

<p>While there are no assessments for wrasse, precautionary management measures have been introduced. The control measures are regarded as a first step to improve management of the wrasse fishery in Scotland. The Marine Directorate of the Scottish Government intends that the measures for the Scottish wrasse fishery will be kept under review and subject to refinement as more evidence becomes available.</p>
