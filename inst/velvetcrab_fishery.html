<p>The velvet crab fishery in Scottish waters is a relatively recent development; velvet crabs were once considered a 'pest' species, and only taken in a small scale fishery for a few months in the winter. With the collapse of the Spanish fishery in the early 1980s the Scottish fishery expanded rapidly to supply southern European markets and became the largest velvet crab fishery in Europe.</p>

<p>Velvet crabs are caught in the inshore creel fishery along with lobster and brown crab. Very few fishermen fish solely for 'velvets'. Previously the fishery was associated mainly with the West coast (Hebrides and South Minch assessment units) and Orkney, but since 2002 landings on the East coast of Scotland have increased substantially. It is not clear whether this is due to an increase in the velvet crab population in this area, an improvement in the reporting system or to more specific targeting of the species.</p>
