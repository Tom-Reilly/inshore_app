<p>The brown crab (<i>Cancer pagurus</i>), also known as the edible crab, lives all around Scotland’s coast - from shallow waters to depths over 100 meters. It prefers rocky reefs, coarse seabed, and muddy sand, especially offshore.</p>

<p>Brown crabs feed mainly on bottom-dwelling animals like clams, small crabs, and barnacles, but they will also scavenge. Like other crustaceans, they grow by moulting - shedding their shell and forming a new one. Young crabs moult often, but older ones may only moult every few years.</p>

<p>Mating happens after the female moults, while her shell is still soft. She carries fertilised eggs under her tail for up to nine months, usually over winter. The larvae drift in the water before settling on the seabed. Juvenile crabs are mostly found in shallow coastal areas.</p>

<p>Adult crabs, especially females, can migrate long distances (sometimes hundreds of kilometres) mainly for breeding. These movements, along with drifting larvae, help connect crab populations across regions.</p>
