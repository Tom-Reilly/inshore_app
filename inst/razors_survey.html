<p>Official Scottish landings and effort data are used for a number of purposes including: to monitor fishing activity in combination with information on vessel activity (as detected by on-board Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) systems), in the calculation of landings per unit effort (LPUE) and in the stock assessments.</p>

<p>The Marine Directorate has worked in collaboration with Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) to develop survey methodologies for razor clams. Surveys to determine razor clam densities were conducted using electrofishing with towed video.</p>

<p>To gather information on the length of landed razor clams, detailed instructions for sampling and measuring razor clams were sent to trial participants and the associated processors. Since August 2018, samples of live razor clams have been collected by trial participants.</p>
