<p>This fishery is currently derogated a scientific trial and is closely monitored. As part of the terms and conditions, all trial participants are required to submit monthly length samples of landed razor clams. Participants may also be required to submit live razor clam samples on request.</p>

<p>All vessels participating in the scheme carry REM systems which record details of vessel position and status of the electrofishing gear at ten second intervals.</p>

<p>The Marine Directorate has worked in collaboration with Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) to develop towed video survey methodologies for razor clams.  Surveys are not regular and do not cover all trial areas.</p>
