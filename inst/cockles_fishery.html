<p>Commercial cockle fishing in the Scottish Solway Firth began in 1980, offering economic benefits, but raising ecological concerns due to the area's importance for birdlife. Fishing methods included hand-picking, tractor dredging, and suction dredging. While suction dredging was efficient, it led to overharvesting, and tractor dredging caused high mortality. Hand-picking was less damaging ecologically, but brought social challenges such as littering and anti-social behaviour, making enforcement difficult.</p>

<p>The Solway Firth previously supported a significant cockle fishery, with landings exceeding 4,500 tonnes in 1991.  However, due to declining stock levels, local concerns, and lack of a comprehensive management plan, the fishery was closed to cockle fishing in 2011 (when the Regulating Order expired).</p>

<p>A study completed in 2015 reported on a potential management regime for a Solway cockle fishery, but unfortunately due to poor cockle yields and difficult market conditions, the project was terminated.  Local fishers and businesses have continued to be keen for this fishery to be reopened, but first it is essential to understand if the available cockle biomass could support a commercial fishery.</p>
