<p>The commercial fishing of cockle stocks in the Scottish Solway Firth, which began in 1980, presented both economic opportunities and ecological challenges. Various fishing methods were employed, including hand-picking, tractor dredging, and suction dredging. While suction dredging was highly efficient, it proved to be unsustainable due to excessive harvesting. Similarly, tractor dredging resulted in high mortality rates among cockles. Hand-picking, though potentially more environmentally friendly, led to significant social issues such as littering and anti-social behaviour, raising concerns within local communities.  It was also very difficult to police.</p>

<p>The Solway Firth is located along the border between Scotland and England and in the past the cockle (<em>Cerastoderma edule</em>) fishery in this region was economically important with landings over 4500 tonnes in 1991. Due to declining stock levels, local concerns, and lack of a comprehensive management plan, the Scottish Solway Firth was closed to cockle fishing in 2011.</p>

<p>A study completed in 2015 reported on a potential management regime for a Solway cockle fishery, but unfortunately due to poor cockle yields and difficult market conditions, the project was terminated.  Local fishers and businesses have continued to be keen for this fishery to be reopened, but first it is important to understand if the available cockle biomass could support a commercial fishery.</p>
