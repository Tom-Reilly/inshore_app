<p>Wrasse (<em>Labridae</em>) are widely distributed and commonly found in tropical to temperate seas. In UK waters, there are eight species, with five common in Scottish waters: Goldsinny (<em>Ctenolabrus rupestris</em>), Rock cook (<em>Centrolabrus exoletus</em>), Corkwing wrasse (<em>Symphodus melops</em>), Ballan wrasse (<em>Labrus bergylta</em>) and Cuckoo wrasse (<em>Labrus mixtus</em>). These species are a component of the demersal fish assemblage in shallow water rocky habitats and are often abundant in and near to kelp forests and other macroalgal habitats. Wrasse mainly eat benthic invertebrates, particularly molluscs, sea urchins, crustaceans and worms. Wrasses are also known to eat ectoparasites of fish, which makes them valuable as 'cleaner fish' in salmon aquaculture.</p>

<p>Wrasses are often territorial with limited home range and high site fidelity, although wrasse have been caught as bycatch offshore indicating the potential wider ranges. There is little known about the pelagic distribution of larval wrasse. They have varied reproductive biology, with some species being nest-guarding, with territorial males protecting eggs as they develop. Some wrasse, <em>e.g.</em> ballan and cuckoo wrasse, are protogynous hermaphrodites, meaning smaller individuals are females that become male when at a sufficiently large size.</p>

<p>Some wrasse exhibit reduced activity in winter, and some members of the <em>Labridae</em> family are known to seek deeper and warmer waters  over winter. In species like goldsinny and rock cook, reduced metabolic activity and feeding allows the fish to enter a hypometabolic state (analogous to hibernation). Reproductive behaviour varies by species. Ballan wrasse females spawn in nests built by males. Rock cook females lay sticky, demersal eggs in 'nests' constructed of algae in rock crevices. Corkwing males are territorial and construct seaweed nests amongst rocks, while goldsinny spawning takes place in mid-water, and they are batch spawners with pelagic eggs that hatch to become planktonic larvae.
Ballan wrasse exhibit a seasonal spawning pattern with peak gonadosomatic index in UK waters observed between March and April.</p>
