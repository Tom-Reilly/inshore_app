<p>Wrasse (Labridae) are widely distributed and commonly found in tropical to temperate seas. In UK waters, there are eight species, with five common in Scottish waters: Goldsinny (Ctenolabrus rupestris), Rock cook (<i>Centrolabrus exoletus</i>), Corkwing wrasse (<i>Symphodus melops</i>), Ballan wrasse (<i>Labrus bergylta</i>) and Cuckoo wrasse (<i>Labrus mixtus</i>). These species prefer shallow water rocky habitats and are often abundant in and near to kelp forests and other macroalgal habitats. <p>Wrasses are often territorial with limited home range and high site fidelity, although wrasse have been caught as bycatch offshore indicating the potential wider ranges.</p>

<p>Wrasse mainly eat benthic invertebrates, particularly molluscs, sea urchins, crustaceans and worms. Wrasses are also known to eat ectoparasites of fish, which makes them valuable as 'cleaner fish' in salmon aquaculture.</p>

<p>Reproductive behaviour varies by species. Some wrasse, <i>e.g.</i> ballan and cuckoo wrasse, are protogynous hermaphrodites, meaning smaller individuals are females that become male when at a sufficiently large size.</p>Ballan wrasse females spawn in nests built by males. Rock cook females lay sticky, demersal eggs in 'nests' constructed of algae in rock crevices. Corkwing males are territorial and construct seaweed nests amongst rocks, while goldsinny spawning takes place in mid-water, and they are batch spawners with pelagic eggs that hatch to become planktonic larvae.</p>
