<p>The onshore shellfish sampling schemes collect biological data on five shellfish species, <em>Nephrops</em>, scallops, lobster and two species of crab (edible and velvet).</p>

<p>Two distinct schemes are used on mainland Scotland and on the Shetland Isles. The scheme on mainland Scotland, which includes sampling in the Orkney Islands and the islands off the west of Scotland, is divided into 15 sampling strata, where any and all of the 5 shellfish species encountered will be sampled. The mainland sampling strata are based on the geographical region and contain landing ports and the local processors that receive shellfish landings from these ports. Collectively the scheme has the potential to cover 78% of the shellfish landed into Scotland, the remaining 22% is typically by small, mainly under 10m, vessels landing infrequently into small and often remote ports. Visits to sampling strata are by designated sampling weeks with observer directed sampling to determine locations and opportunities for data collection. There are at present no probability-based selection methods employed, sampling being <em>ad hoc</em> and opportunistic.</p>

Shellfish sampling in Shetland is sub-contracted and the MOU governing its operation sets out target numbers by species of the data to be collected. Data on the landings of 4 species are collected (there are no Nephrops landings into Shetland)

For all individuals the appropriate carapace/shell length measures are taken, for Nephrops sex and breeding condition is recorded and for scallop the meat weight is recorded.

A ratio estimator is used to estimate landed numbers-at-age or length and bootstrapping is used to estimate corresponding standard errors and confidence intervals for these estimates. Data are stored in the national database and also in spreadsheets and are compiled into a documented R package for analyses, at each stage, rigorous quality checking procedures are followed.
