<p> MRV Alba na Mara is used for the four annual scallop dredge surveys to gather information on the distribution and catch rates of scallops. The surveys also provide information on age and length composition, growth rates, bycatch and other biological data. Reports of scallop research vessel surveys can be found <a href="https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/search/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Sampling of scallops is undertaken by Marine Directrate staff at markets and processors, where length and age measurements are taken.</p>

<p>In 2023, over the four surveys 245 stations were sampled with 34,560 individuals measured.  Details of sample numbers and survey targets can be found in the 2023 report, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-collection-framework">here</a>.</p>
