<p>In 2023 and 2024, cockles in the Solway Firth were surveyed by SeaScope Fisheries Research Ltd, with data analysed by the Marine Directorate of the Scottish Government. Nine beaches identified as important cockle habitats were sampled using a random stratified approach.</p>

<p>At each station, a 0.1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat was excavated to 100 mm depth and sieved with a 5 mm mesh. All cockles were measured, aged by counting external growth rings, and weighed individually to support length–weight analysis. </p>
