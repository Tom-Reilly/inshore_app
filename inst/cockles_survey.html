<p>In 2023 and 2024 Solway Firth cockles were surveyed by SeaScope Fisheries Research Limited and data analysed by Scottish Government’s Marine Directorate. Nine areas that have been identified as important habitats for cockles in the Solway Firth are sampled using a random stratified sampling methodology. A two-stage adaptive survey procedure was used in survey sites with higher abundances of cockles aged two years and older.</p>

<p>Stations are sampled using a 0.1m<sup>2</sup> quadrat sample. Sediment was removed to a depth of 100mm
and sieved using a 5mm meshed sieve. All whole undamaged cockles collected at each sampling station are aged, measured using digital vernier callipers and weighed using a digital balance. Cockles are aged by counting external growth rings/bands.  Any cockles without visible growth rings are classed as 0 group cockles (zero age group).  Cockles were weighed individually to allow length/weight relationship data to be investigated for each survey site, where weight = <em>a x Length<sup>b</sup></em>.</p>
