<p>The earliest records of lobster fishing in Scotland date back to the 12th century when lobsters were caught by hand using 'crooks' and hoop nets. With the introduction of baited traps (creels), exploitation on a more commercial basis developed, and today there are important creel fisheries for the European lobster in many areas around the Scottish coast.</p>

<p>Scottish lobster fisheries are now almost entirely creel-based, with small-scale vessels operating close to shore. These fisheries are particularly important to remote and island communities, providing valuable income and employment. Lobsters are typically landed live and exported to European markets, where they command high prices. The fishery is managed through a combination of licensing, gear restrictions and minimum landing sizes to help protect stocks.</p>
