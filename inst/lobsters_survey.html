<p>Scientists visit markets and processers all around Scotland to obtain length frequency data for lobsters as part of the Marine Directorate  market sampling programme. Lobsters are sexed and the carapace width measured using digital callipers. Care is taken when handling live crabs to avoid damaging the product.</p>

<p>On occasion, short term projects are undertaken to collect additional data for lobsters. <a href="https://rifg.scot/storage/meeting/90/Solway%20Lobster%20Derogation%20Project%20Presentation%20%20-%20Interim%20Measures%20Review%20Event%2005%20March%202025.pdf">A current project underway in the Solway Firth is using Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) on fishing vessels to assess the proportion of berried lobsters caught</a>.</p>
