<p>Scientists visit markets and processors all around Scotland to obtain length frequency data for brown crab as part of the Marine Directorate (MD) market sampling programme. Crabs are sexed and the carapace width measured using digital callipers. Care is taken when handling live crabs to avoid damaging the product.</p>

<p>Whilst there are no direct research vessel surveys for brown crab around Scotland, they are a bycatch species in dredge and trawl surveys undertaken by MD.  Data from these surveys have been used to provide indices of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/78/2/597/5880823?login=false">brown crab stock size and information on spatial distribution</a>.</p>
