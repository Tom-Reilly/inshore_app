<p>Scientists on board research vessels conduct annual surveys to estimate <i>Nephrops</i> stock abundance around Scotland. At each survey station, a custom-built sledge is towed along the seabed and <i>Nephrops</i> burrows are counted and used to derive population density estimates.</p>

<p>Sampling of commercially trawl caught <i>Nephrops</i> is undertaken by fisheries observers onboard vessels. Co-sampling also takes place at some ports around Scotland, where commercial vessels bring ashore baskets of unwanted catch. Sampling at market of both trawl and creel caught <i>Nephrops</i> is carried out on a weekly basis at ports around Scotland. <i>Nephrops</i> are sexed and the carapace width measured using digital callipers. Care is taken when handling live <i>Nephrops</i> to avoid damaging the product.</p>
