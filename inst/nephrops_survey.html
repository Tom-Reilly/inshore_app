<p> Scientists on board research vessels conduct three annual Underwater Television (UWTV) surveys to estimate <em>Nephrops</em> stock abundance around Scotland. At each station, a custom-built sledge is towed along the seabed and <em>Nephrops</em> burrows are counted and used to derive population density estimates. Reports of <em>Nephrops</em> research vessel surveys can be found <a href="https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/search/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Sampling of commercially trawl caught <em>Nephrops</em> is undertaken by fisheries observers onboard vessels. Sampling at market of both trawl and creel caught <em>Nephrops</em> is carried out on a weekly basis at ports around Scotland.</p>

<p>In 2023, 330 UWTV stations were sampled on research surveys, with 466 individuals measured during trawls on these surveys. 144,743 individuals were measured during market sampling and 13,321 during observer sampling. Details of sample numbers can be found in the 2023 report, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-collection-framework">here</a>.</p>
