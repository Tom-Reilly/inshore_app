<p> The brown or edible crab (<em>Cancer pagurus</em>) is found all around the Scottish coast from the shallow sub-littoral into offshore waters to depths exceeding 100 m on offshore grounds. It inhabits rocky reefs, mixed coarse grounds and soft sediments (muddy sand) particularly on the offshore grounds.</p>

<p>Brown crabs mainly eat benthic invertebrates, particularly bivalves, small decapods and barnacles; although their capture in baited traps indicates that they will also scavenge for food. In common with other crustaceans, brown crab grow by casting (moulting) their shell and then hardening a new larger shell. Growth rate varies between areas. Small animals may moult several times in a year, but at larger sizes growth slows down and the inter-moult period can be as long as four years.</p>

<p>During courtship the mature female is guarded by a male. Mating takes place post moult while the shell is still soft. Fertilised eggs are carried under the female's 'tail' for up to nine months over the winter, until they hatch. The larvae are pelagic and drift with water movements until they settle to the seabed. Juvenile crabs are more commonly found in shallow inshore waters.</p>

<p>Adult crabs, especially females, can undertake extensive seasonal migrations (100s km), behaviour thought to be associated with reproduction. Migration of adults and the dispersal of larvae will both influence the connectivity of stocks.</p>
