<p>The wrasse fishery developed primarily to supply the aquaculture industry, where the fish are used as 'cleaner fish' to control sea lice infestations in Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) farms, reducing dependency on veterinary medicines. In Scottish waters, fishing for wrasse (using traps, creels, pots) commenced in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Control measures for the Scottish wrasse fishery were introduced in 2021 following consultation. These include seasonal derogations, minimum and maximum landing sizes for different wrasse species, trap limitations (a maximum of 250 wrasse traps within any 24-hour period), and comprehensive data reporting requirements.</p>

<p>The highest landings of wrasse (by weight) are reported for the West Coast of Scotland, with some fishing activity also recorded around Orkney Islands and to a lesser extent in the Moray Firth and Shetland Islands.</p>
