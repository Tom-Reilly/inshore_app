<p>The wrasse fishery developed primarily to supply the aquaculture industry, where the fish are used as 'cleaner fish' to control sea lice infestations in Atlantic salmon (<em>Salmo salar</em>) farms, reducing dependency on veterinary medicines. In Scottish waters, fishing for wrasse commenced in the 1990s. The fishery is seasonal, as few fish are caught when the sea temperature is <7&deg;C, and corresponds with deployment on Salmon farms.  The wrasse fishing season occurs between 1<sup>st</sup> May to 30<sup>th</sup> November each year, restricting fishing outwith the spawning season.</p>

<p>Wrasse are caught using traps (creels, pots) deployed from <10m boats, for live transfer to Scottish salmon farms. Individual wrasses are valued at £10-17.50 per fish as of 2023, making them a valuable fishery species and providing inshore fishing fleets an opportunity to diversify.</p>

<p>Ballan wrasse is the most common species landed, accounting for 73% of reported landings (by weight) in 2021 and 81% in 2022. In 2021, 61 derogations were issued for the wrasse fishery with 51 vessels reporting landings, and in 2022, 63 derogations were issued with 47 vessels reporting landings.
The highest landings of wrasse (by weight) are reported for the West Coast of Scotland, with some fishing activity also recorded around Orkney Islands and to a lesser extent in the Moray Firth and Shetland Islands.</p>

<p>Control measures for the Scottish wrasse fishery were introduced in 2021 following consultation. These include minimum and maximum landing sizes for different wrasse species, trap limitations (a maximum of 250 wrasse traps within any 24-hour period), and comprehensive data reporting requirements.</p>
