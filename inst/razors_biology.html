<p>Razor clams (<i>Ensis sp.</i>) are marine bivalve molluscs commonly found around the coast of Europe, inhabiting sediments from fine sand to soft mud in the intertidal and sub-tidal areas. Often referred to as 'spoots', three species are widely distributed around Scotland; <i>E.siliqua</i>, <i>E.magnus</i> (also known as <i>E.arcuatus</i>) and <i>E.ensis</i>. <i>E.siliqua</i> (the 'pod' razor) is the razor clam species typically targeted by the fishery in Scotland.</p>
