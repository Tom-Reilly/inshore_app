<p>Razor clams (<em>Ensis sp.</em>) are marine bivalve molluscs commonly found around the coast of Europe, inhabiting sediments from fine sand to soft mud in the intertidal and sub-tidal areas. Often referred to as 'spoots', three species are widely distributed around Scotland; <em>E.siliqua</em>, <em>E.magnus</em> (also known as <em>E.arcuatus</em>) and <em>E.ensis</em>. <em>E.siliqua</em> (the 'pod' razor) is the razor clam species typically targeted by the fishery in Scotland, and anecdotal information from the Scottish fishing industry suggests there has been a targeted fishery for razor clams for many years.</p>
